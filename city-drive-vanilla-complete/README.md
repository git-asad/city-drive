## Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Configuration
1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Enable Authentication and Firestore Database
3. Update the Firebase config in `index.html`:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "123456789",
    appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### 2. Firestore Security Rules
Add these basic security rules to your Firestore database:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Cars can be read by anyone, written by owners
    match /cars/{carId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && resource.data.ownerId == request.auth.uid;
    }

    // Bookings can be read/written by involved parties
    match /bookings/{bookingId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        (request.auth.uid == resource.data.customerId ||
         request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId);
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Run the Application
1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Or use a local server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server

   # Or use VS Code Live Server extension
   ```
